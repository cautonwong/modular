## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Full architecture decision record `docs/adr.md` (D1-D85).
- Industrial CI/CD: build caching, coverage gate, JUnit test reports,
  reproducible build metadata, pinned GitHub Actions, and a tag-driven
  release pipeline.
- Governance and quality configuration: `CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `.clang-format`, `.clang-tidy`, `.editorconfig`, Dependabot.
- Architecture guard self-tests and a CMake/main app-list consistency check.

### Fixed

- Restored the default (warnings-as-errors) build by adding explicit port
  adapter trampolines in `product/example/glue.c`.
- Made the Cortex-M0 cross build reproducible by removing the implicit
  newlib dependency in `infra/flash`.
- Removed obsolete V2/V3 architecture leftovers (manifest/loader docs,
  linker-section registry, descriptor-based demo and tests).

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Thin `edge_module` framework contract: module lifecycle, bounded ISR event
  queue with timestamping, central event IDs, injected clock/log ports.
- Deterministic `sys` scheduler: priority + module-id ordering, required-set
  validation, transactional init rollback, explicit event subscription and
  reverse-order shutdown.
- Board IRQ-to-event forwarding boundary and consumer-defined DLT645 port with
  a product composition-root adapter.
- GCC/Clang, sanitizer, coverage, static-analysis and Cortex-M0 cross-build CI
  with a firmware size budget.
